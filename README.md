# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

This repository is used to store and share homework assignments and projects completed during Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalks.Club.

## Working Environment

To complete the tasks and projects in this zoomcamp, I'll'be using an Ampere A1 instance in Oracle Cloud, a compute resource offered with Arm-based Ampere A1 cores. The free tier allows you to create an instance with up to 4 cores and 24 GB of memory, along with 200GB of disk. The free tier limit covers 3,000 OCPU hours and 18,000 GB hours per month, which is enough to keep this instance running all month. For more information, you can find it at this [link](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/).
